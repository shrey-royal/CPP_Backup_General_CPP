1. Temperature Conversion: Write a C++ program that includes functions to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. The user should be able to input a temperature in one unit and get the converted temperature in the other unit.

2. Factorial Calculation: Create a C++ program that calculates the factorial of a given integer using a function. The program should prompt the user to enter a positive integer and then display the factorial.

3. Prime Number Check: Write a C++ function that takes an integer as input and returns true if it's a prime number, and false otherwise. The main program should prompt the user for an integer and display whether it's prime or not.

4. Palindrome Check: Develop a C++ program that uses a function to check if a given string is a palindrome or not. The program should prompt the user to enter a string and then display the result.

5. Array Manipulation: Create a C++ program with functions to find the sum, average, maximum, and minimum values in an array of integers. The user should input the array, and the program should display the results.

6. String Manipulation: Write a C++ function that takes two strings as input and returns true if one is an anagram of the other, and false otherwise. An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word.

7. Fibonacci Series: Develop a C++ program that generates the Fibonacci series up to a given number n using a function. The user should input the value of n, and the program should display the Fibonacci series.

8. Linear Search: Implement a C++ function to perform a linear search in an array for a given element. The function should return the index of the element if found, or -1 if not found. The main program should prompt the user to input the array and the element to search.

9. Quadratic Equation Solver: Write a C++ program that includes a function to solve quadratic equations (ax^2 + bx + c = 0) given the coefficients a, b, and c. The program should prompt the user to input the coefficients and display the solutions.

10. Matrix Multiplication: Create a C++ program that multiplies two matrices using functions. The user should input the dimensions and elements of the matrices, and the program should display the resulting matrix.
